Apply these minimal edits to your bot.py (no other changes):

1) Define the special-admin check right after SPECIAL_ADMIN_IDS:

# --- add below SPECIAL_ADMIN_IDS ---
def special_admin_only():
    async def predicate(interaction: discord.Interaction) -> bool:
        return interaction.user.id in SPECIAL_ADMIN_IDS
    return app_commands.check(predicate)
# --- end add ---

2) Add the decorator above these commands (place this decorator immediately above each command decorator block):

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="status", description="Show bot status and statistics")

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="keys", description="Show all keys for a user")

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="backup", description="Create a backup of all keys")

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="restore", description="Restore keys from a backup file")

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="activekeys", description="List all active keys with remaining time and assigned user")

@special_admin_only()
@bot.tree.command(name="expiredkeys", description="List expired keys")

3) Set start_time to fix uptime in /status. In on_ready() after change_presence, add:

bot.start_time = datetime.datetime.utcnow()

4) Add a friendly error for non-admins. In your @bot.tree.error handler, add this branch:

elif isinstance(error, discord.app_commands.CheckFailure):
    try:
        await interaction.response.send_message("❌ You don't have permission to use this command.", ephemeral=True)
    except Exception:
        try:
            await interaction.followup.send("❌ You don't have permission to use this command.")
        except Exception:
            pass

5) After deploying, restart the bot and run in your guild once:

/synccommands
